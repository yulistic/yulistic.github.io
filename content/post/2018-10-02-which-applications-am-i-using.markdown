Here are the lists of applications that I prefer. 

# Common
* git commit log visualization: `tig`

# Manjaro
* screenshot(screen capture): `flameshot`, `gnome-screenshot`
* tiling window manager: `i3wm`
* pdf-viewer: `zathura` with `mupdf` plugin (vim-like shortcuts)
* academic paper management: `mendeley` (easy to share, multi-platform)

The list will be updated continually.
