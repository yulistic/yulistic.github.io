**Problem**: I cannot see posts. It shows "404 not found".

**Solution**: Add "try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;" to the _"location /"_ block in the nginx configuration file.

Refer to the following example.

========================== /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf =======
...
location / {
root /usr/share/nginx/html/yulistic;
index index.php index.html index.htm;
**try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;Â **
}
...
===========================================================
